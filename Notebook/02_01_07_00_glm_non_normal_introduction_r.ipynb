They are particularly useful for non-normal continuous data, such as positive skewed values (e.g., costs, times), proportions, or rates, where assumptions like normality, homoscedasticity, or unbounded ranges do not hold."

Key models include: Gamma regression for positive skewed data, Inverse Gaussian for highly skewed continuous data, Beta regression for proportions, Zero-One Inflated Beta for proportions with excess boundaries, Fractional regression for bounded ratios, Dirichlet regression for compositional data, and Tweedie regression for data with a mix of zeros and positive values. Each model addresses unique challenges such as skewness, boundedness, and zero-inflation, making GLMs versatile for diverse applications in fields like economics, ecology, and engineering. Proper model selection, fitting, and diagnostics are crucial for accurate inference and prediction in non-normal continuous data contexts."
